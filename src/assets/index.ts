/**
 * This file serves as a central repository for image and video assets used throughout the carousel component
 * and potentially other parts of the web application. By exporting assets from a single location, it simplifies
 * the process of importing and using these assets in various components, ensuring consistency and easing maintenance.
 *
 * The exports include:
 * - Carousel images: A collection of images used specifically for the carousel component to display rotating banners or highlights.
 * - Background blobs: Decorative background images to enhance the visual appeal of sections or components.
 * - Feature images and videos: Assets used to highlight specific features, products, or services offered by the application.
 * - Other assets: Including the founder's image for a personal touch in sections like 'About Us', and the company logo for branding purposes.
